   A no-contest plea is a means by which an offender agrees to allow themselves to be convicted, rather than requiring the state to prove its case. No contest pleas may be equivocal or unequivocal. Unequivocal no-contest pleas are generally limited to guilty pleas. When a defendant unequivocally pleads guilty, they admit their actual culpability in the offence pleaded to and accept the consequences of doing so. Equivocal no-contest pleas, on the other hand, include best-interest pleas and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, both formal and informal. When a defendant equivocally pleads no-contest, they agree to self-conviction without taking full, or any, responsibility for the offence.
   
   In Canada, although statutory language formally forbids equivocal no-contest pleas, they may still be entered informally, and sometimes surreptitiously. In this thesis, I argue that both the legal and ethical objections to these pleas and plea bargaining more generally in Canada are largely misplaced. Equivocal no-contest pleas open new avenues of plea bargaining for defendants and prosecutors to explore, and therefore create new opportunities for both certainty, factual accuracy, agency, and mutual advantage in what are otherwise highly adversarial proceedings. I conclude by recommending ways in which equivocal no-contest pleas could be adapted and used in the Canadian criminal context.
