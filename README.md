# LLM-Thesis

A thesis (eventually) satisfying the requirements of my LLM degree at Robson Hall Faculty of Law, University of Manitoba. Comments, questions, and suggestions are all welcome!

## Abstract

A no-contest plea allows criminal defendants to self-convict without requiring the state to prove its case against them. No-contest pleas may be inculpatory, exculpatory, or non-inculpatory. Guilty pleas are inculpatory no-contest pleas. When a defendant pleads guilty sincerely, they formally take responsibility for the offence and accept the consequences of doing so. Exculpatory and non-inculpatory no-contest pleas include best-interest pleas and *nolo contendere* pleas, respectively. When a  enters one of these pleas, they agree to self-convict without formally taking responsibility for the offence.
   
In this thesis, I argue that the legal and ethical objections to these pleas and plea bargaining generally in Canada are largely misplaced. *Nolo contendere* pleas open new avenues of plea bargaining for defendants and prosecutors to explore, creating new opportunities for certainty, factual accuracy, agency, and mutual advantage in otherwise highly adversarial proceedings. Although statutory language formally forbids *nolo contendere* pleas in Canada, defendants may still enter them informally and surreptitiously. I conclude by arguing that these pleas be formalized and suggesting ways to implement them.

# TODO
* Find additional examples of plea bargaining opponents arguing that plea bargaining nets few or no efficiencies
  * Alschuler, citing several sources, at 29f
  * Ireland at 273
* Parenthetically note that admissions can be made under 606(4)
* Mention that one of the biggest problems with pre-trial conditions is the way they serve to generate additional administration of justice charges. Cite one of the more recent decisions on bail by the SCC (Zora?)
* Cite the Oregon provision requiring defendants to have equal opportunities to plea bargain

## Ireland article
* Only a small number of criminal cases proceed to trial (273)
* Plea bargaining is economnic in nature (274): ``Our criminal justice system is therefore mostly a system of guilty pleas where accused persons offer their plea of guilty as a commodity to be exchanged for (perceived) benefits granted by the state. The majority of these exchanges occur within the crucible of plea bargaining."
* Plea bargaining is an unregulated and procedurally fraught process that many academics rightfully criticize (274)
* Martin Commission in 1993 was a watershed moment for plea bargaining in Canada (275)
* See also Albert W Alschuler, "Plea Bargaining And Its History" (1979) 13:2 Law & Soc'y Rev 211 at 213 (HL) for a concise definition in the American context: "plea bargaining consists of the exchange of official concessions for the [defendant's] act of self-conviction."
* Detailed plea bargaining definitions on 277, including a detailed list of potential consideration that a defendant may offer in exchange for their GP
* Joint recommendations may lead to a culture of expediency, wherein these recommendations are being made without good reason (278f)
* Empirical studies about plea bargaining are rare in Canada (279)
* Plea bargains were historically discouraged (280f)
* May be able to largely defer to Ireland's analysis of plea bargaining's history, as it's both concise and good. His insights largely depend on Alschuler, whose scholarship is a bit ehhh, but it provides a fairly adequate overview of what's what (282)
* The notion that plea bargaining is necessary to support the justice system is dubious (282)
  * "Plea bargaining began as principled compromise, hardened into contract, and then degenerated into disaster"
