\chapter{Conclusion}

Non-inculpatory no-contest pleas do not have a longstanding history in Canadian criminal law, and are formally precluded. Nevertheless, they should be statutorily incorporated into Canadian criminal law. 

They are easily compatible with Canadian criminal law, such that they can be informally entered

Equivocal no-contest pleas increase the opportunities for plea bargains, thereby increasing opportunities for mutually successful outcomes in criminal proceedings

Equivocal no-contest pleas open up opportunities for both prosecutors and defendants that wouldn't normally be available to them

\textit{Nolo contendere} and best-interest pleas can be codified and customized even further to refine the legislative tools used to prosecute, defend, and process criminal cases
