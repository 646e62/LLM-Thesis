\chapter{Should no-contest pleas be further incorporated into Canadian criminal law?}

Having defined no-contest pleas and outlined their current legal status in Canadian criminal law, I move on to ask whether they should be further incorporated into the Canadian criminal legal matrix. 

The defendant doesn't want to have a trial for one of many reasons a defendant may not want to have a trial

Desire to not have one or more witnesses testify

Inability to separate moral culpability from a formal guilty plea

Belief that one is morally in the right despite being legally in the wrong
