\chapter{What are uncontested pleas?}

\setcounter{footnote}{13}

In this thesis, I ask whether \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, a type of uncontested plea, should be permitted and encouraged in Canadian criminal law. To that end, this chapter provides some historical background to guilty and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. I start by defining what pleas are and explaining their role in Canadian criminal law. I follow this by briefly surveying the history and current status of guilty and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. For guilty pleas, I examine the plea voluntariness and comprehension inquiries developed and their current status. For \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, I explain KA Drechsler's four-component \textit{nolo contendere} classification system,\footnote{See KA Drechsler, ``Plea of nolo contendere or non vult contendere", Annotation, (1944) 152 ALR 253 - 254 [\textit{Drechsler's annotation}].} briefly survey the Canadian \textit{nolo contendere} procedure, and summarize the current status of \textit{nolo contendere} pleas in North America using these categories.
