\chapter{What Are Uncontested Pleas?}

\setcounter{footnote}{25}

I ask whether \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, a type of uncontested plea, should be permitted in Canadian criminal law and encouraged in Canadian criminal procedure. To those ends, this chapter provides some background to guilty and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. I start by defining what pleas are and explaining their role in Canadian criminal law. I follow this by briefly surveying the history and current status of guilty and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. For guilty pleas, I examine the plea voluntariness and comprehension inquiries developed and the plea inquiry's current legal status. For \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, I explain KA Drechsler's four-part \textit{nolo contendere} classification system,\footnote{See KA Drechsler, ``Plea of nolo contendere or non vult contendere", Annotation, (1944) 152 ALR 253 â€” 254 [\textit{Drechsler's Annotation}].} briefly introduce the Canadian \textit{nolo contendere} procedure, and summarize the current status of \textit{nolo contendere} pleas in the United States using these categories.
