\chapter{What are uncontested pleas?}

This thesis asks whether \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, a type of uncontested plea, should be permitted and encouraged in Canadian criminal law. To help answer this question, this section provides historical background to guilty and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. I start by defining the term ``uncontested plea" and explain its historical role in Canadian criminal law. I follow this by examining the history and current status of guilty pleas and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. For guilty pleas, I examine the plea voluntariness and comprehension inquires that developed and the plea inquiry's current status. For \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, I explain KA Dreschler's four-component \textit{nolo contendere} classification system, briefly survey the Canadian \textit{nolo contendere} procedure, and summarize the current status of \textit{nolo contendere} pleas in North America.
