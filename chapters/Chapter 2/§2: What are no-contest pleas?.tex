\chapter{What are no-contest pleas?}

This thesis asks whether \textit{nolo contendere} pleas, a type of no-contest plea, should be permitted and encouraged in Canadian criminal law. To that end, this section provides historical background to guilty and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas. I first define the term ``no-contest plea" and explain its role and history in Canadian criminal law. Next, I examine the plea bargaining process and identify the impact that plea bargaining has had on both no-contest pleas specifically and the justice system more broadly. Finally, I examine the history and current status of guilty pleas and \textit{nolo contendere} pleas.
