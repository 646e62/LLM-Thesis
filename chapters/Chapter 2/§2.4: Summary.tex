\section{Summary}

An uncontested plea is any plea to a criminal charge where the defendant self-convicts without the prosecutor needing to call evidence against them. Two uncontested pleas, guilty and \textit{nolo contendere}, have been formally authorized and legislated in various jurisdictions throughout America, while Canada only formally recognizes guilty pleas. \textit{Nolo contendere} pleas were developed in Britain and imported to North America alongside British rule. Only America appears to have used it between the 17\textsuperscript{th} and 21\textsuperscript{st} centuries. But since the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, Canada has begun to implement \textit{nolo contendere} pleas informally. The following section explores this forked development and examines whether it would be \textit{possible} to formally merge \textit{nolo contendere} pleas into Canadian criminal law.
