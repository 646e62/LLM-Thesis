\section{Guilty: the inculpatory plea}

\subsection{The history of the guilty plea}

The modern guilty plea evolved from a longstanding practice where courts allowed defendants to confess their crimes without requiring the state to prove them. Before the 11\textsuperscript{th} century Norman conquest, the Anglo-Saxons of England established a procedure for confessions to criminal charges.\footnote{See Alschuler, Plea Bargaining and Its History at 7. See also H. ADAMS, H. LODGE, E. YouNG \& J. LAUGHLIN, ESSAYS IN ANGLO-SAXON LAW at 285, \url{https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015017688113\&view=1up\&seq=314.}} Confessions were rudimentary and fraught with risks to those who entered them. Nevertheless, they served as the precursor to the modern-day guilty plea and its procedural protections.

Although common law jurisdictions have long allowed self-convictions, there is some debate between jurists, scholars, and legal professionals as to how frequently the courts used these procedures and customs and how well the judiciary historically received them. These disagreements tend to form along the lines of one's view of the practice of plea bargaining. Proponents of plea bargaining see guilty pleas as an age-old institution,\footnote{See example.} while opponents of plea bargaining tend to view them as a more recent procedural compromise made in the name of expedient justice.\footnote{See Alschuler, Plea Bargaining, at 2.} Both should agree that evidence of a modern equivalent of a guilty plea has been largely absent for much of common law history. Fewer reports of common law confessions exist compared to reports of jury trials,\footnote{Alschuler takes the view that guilty pleas were relatively rare until the 19\textsuperscript{th} century. He relies on the fact that relatively few reported decisions cover defendants pleading guilty before this time. There are problems with this approach. Notably, the percentage of reported criminal decisions recording guilty pleas nowadays does not align with the percentage of criminal cases that resolve in a guilty plea. Compare ONCJ stats for 2021 and the 2021 PC survey results. Thus it is hasty to conclude that the low number of reported guilty pleas before the 19\textsuperscript{th} century correlates with a low number of guilty pleas defendants entered. Alschuler's observation further undermines his position that courts had already begun requiring that all guilty pleas entered be voluntary, a relatively sophisticated development for a supposedly underutilized plea procedure.} and there is evidence to suggest that some courts historically ran trials as frequently as contemporary courtrooms hear guilty pleas.\footnote{Find and cite the article that mentions courts where ran dozens of trials daily. Probably Bibas.} 

As common law confessions gave way to the nascent beginnings of a modern guilty plea, there is evidence that judges were reluctant to accept them.\footnote{Cite an example.} It was only toward the end of the 19\textsuperscript{th} century when courts began regularly reporting cases involving guilty pleas.\footnote{See Alschuler at 7 - 8.} By the 1920s, criminal justice surveys in America revealed that many more defendants opted for self-conviction over a trial.\footnote{See Alschuler at 26. The percentages of guilty pleas Alschuler reports range between 76 - 90\% in several major American cities at the time.} These surveys prompted subsequent investigations into the role that plea bargaining played in these statistics. Many were initially surprised by these outcomes, and plea bargaining began with more critics than advocates.\footnote{Cite this as well.} Nevertheless, it continues to be practiced, developed, regulated and refined to the present day.

\subsection{Plea voluntariness and comprehension}

Common law jurisdictions typically require that defendants enter guilty pleas knowingly and voluntarily. However, the courts' understanding and applying the idea of a ``knowing and voluntary'' guilty plea differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Other jurisdictions require courts to canvass different factors, but some that commonly arise include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Voluntariness.} Defendants entering pleas must do so voluntarily and not as the result of undue coercion, threats, or inducements.
\item \textbf{Knowledge.} The defendant must understand the nature and consequences of their plea.
\item \textbf{Factual basis.} Courts must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to sustain a conviction.\footnote{This requirement is similar to the requirement in many (though not all) American states that defendants enter \textit{nolo contendere} pleas with a factual foundation and the rule that all \textit{Alford} pleas must be supported by a factual foundation.}
\item \textbf{Collateral consequences.} A criminal conviction may result in automatic penalties that affect other aspects of a person's life, such as their ability to remain in the country, operate a vehicle, or purchase a firearm.
\end{itemize}

Not every jurisdiction requires courts to canvass each of these factors with defendants before sentencing. Where courts canvass these factors, local legislation, court rules, and customs may require courts to consider additional and different sub-factors or examine the factors in light of particular and different circumstances. 

\subsubsection{Voluntariness and knowledge}

Assuming that judges found guilty pleas suspect for much of the plea's existence, the common law requirement that defendants enter guilty pleas voluntarily, subjectively understood, and based on a factual foundation makes perfect contextual sense. As early as the 16\textsuperscript{th} century, English courts required that defendants enter guilty pleas voluntarily,\footnote{See Alschuler at 12.} a practice that Alschuler attributes to the co-evolution of the plea alongside the common law confessions rule.\footnote{See Alschuler at 12 - 15.} A defendant's right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is the common law's primary tool to prevent state overreach and abuses. To preserve these fundamental rights, defendants must understand that confessing may compromise those rights and increase the likelihood of a subsequent criminal conviction. Where the prosecutors wish to use a defendant's confession, Canadian courts require the state to prove that the confession was voluntary. 

As with confessions, guilty pleas allow defendants to self-convict. However, unlike confessions, courts presume that guilty pleas were validly entered. Where a defendant wishes to argue otherwise, the burden of proof is on them to do so. This presumption is made possible by the plea voluntariness and knowledge inquiry.

\subsubsection{Factual basis}

In addition to ensuring that defendants enter guilty pleas knowingly and voluntarily, judges must also ensure that there is some factual basis for the plea. Courts should not expect people to be sentenced for criminal charges that they are not or are unlikely to be found guilty of, and prosecutors must not pursue charges that lack a reasonable prospect of conviction.\footnote{See case.} A sentencing judge's obligation to ensure a factual foundation for the plea ensures that the allegations are ``peer-reviewed'' to a degree. Judges are not expected or allowed to operate as independent fact-finders.\footnote{See \textit{R v Woroniuk}, 2019 MBCA 77, where the Manitoba Court of Appeal reversed a ``flagrant error in law" committed by a sentencing judge who undertook to investigate the factors laid out by counsel at sentencing.} As a result, the scope of the judge's inquiry into the charge's factual foundation is limited but the inquiry is nevertheless required.

\subsubsection{Collateral consequences}

The term ``collateral consequences" refers to the consequences resulting from a guilty plea that do not directly stem from the sentence the court imposes. These consequences can be legal or extralegal. Legal collateral consequences result from intersections between different legislative schemes, where a decision made under one legislative scheme has consequences under another. These consequences may include such things as extended driving restrictions imposed by the provincial licensor (rather than the court), restrictions on purchasing certain medications or other substances, and cancelled foreign work permits and permanent resident designations, amongst many others.\footnote{See eg the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction, online: \textless https://niccc.nationalreentryresourcecenter.org/\textgreater}

Not every jurisdiction treats these factors the same. In Canada, for example, collateral consequences are a valid consideration when sentencing. However, Canadian courts are not explicitly required to canvass these consequences with defendants before they enter their guilty pleas. Where collateral consequence inquiries are required, they are not uniform, with some states requiring that courts inform defendants of some consequences but not others. By contrast, many American jurisdictions have codified requirements that courts alert defendants of certain collateral consequences of pleading guilty to an offence. Requirements that courts tell defendants about collateral gun ownership and immigration consequences are common,\footnote{For gun ownership, see: for immigration, see: .} but there are hundreds of possible legal collateral consequences across American jurisdictions.

Collateral consequences may also be extra-legal. A good example of extra-legal collateral consequences occurred in the \textit{Suter} decision.\footnote{See \textit{R v Suter}, 2018 SCC 34 (CanLII), [2018] 2 SCR 496.} Suter, the appellant and defendant at trial, drove onto a restaurant patio and killed a two-year-old child. He refused to provide a breath sample when required and pleaded guilty to refusing to provide a sample in a case causing death. Before pleading guilty, 

\subsection{Guilty pleas in Canada}

Before Parliament codified Canadian criminal law in 1892, reported decisions dealing with guilty pleas were rare in Canada. I was only able to locate two such decisions while researching this thesis.\footnote{See \textit{R v Morrison}, 1879 CarswellNB 35 and \textit{R v Morin}, 1890 CarswellQue 17.} However, following codification, reported cases dealing with guilty pleas abounded. This proliferation resulted in early and frequent developments in guilty plea procedures in Canada.

Judicial decisions throughout Canada began demonstrating the importance of ensuring that defendants only entered guilty pleas knowingly and voluntarily and started to develop the procedural rights and waivers that guilty pleas entailed. In the early days of Canadian criminal law, courts did not agree whether entering a guilty plea waived a defendant's right to have a trial.\footnote{See @1992CanLII2570.} Following codification, it became more explicit at law that guilty pleas amounted to a complete waiver of the right to trial.\footnote{See @1914CarswellYukon6, where the court treats the subject as a viable but generally settled question of law.} Before codification, courts operated on the principle that a person pleading guilty must be presumed to know the law.\footnote{See \textit{Morrison} at paras 9, 13; \textit{Morin} at para 145.} However, developments in the following decades began to shed more light on the importance of ensuring that defendants better knew the implications of their plea before entering it.

\subsubsection{Voluntariness and knowledge}

See @1908CarswellSask23, where the Saskatchewan District Court investigated whether a defendant entered a guilty plea under oppressive circumstances or if state agents induced the defendant to enter it.

See also @1928CarswellNS10, where the Nova Scotia Supreme Court allowed a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea after entering it without adequate knowledge of its consequences.

\subsubsection{Factual basis}

See @1903CarswellOnt829, where the Ontario Supreme Court quashed a guilty plea, having found that it was not consistent with facts otherwise accepted as proven.

\subsubsection{Collateral consequences}



Some common law requirements.\footnote{See \textit{R v Wong}, 2018 SCC 25: legally relevant collateral consequences.}

\subsubsection{Unequivocal}

Unlike other common law jurisdictions, Canadian common law requires that defendants who enter guilty pleas do so \textit{unequivocally}. Prior to \textit{Wong}, courts usually cited this requirement to an influential dissent in \textit{Adgey v R}, 1973 CanLII 37 (SCC), [1975] 2 SCR 426.\footnote{``[A]n appellate Court should interfere to set aside a conviction made upon a plea of guilty if it be the case that (1) the accused did not understand the nature of the charge before pleading; or (2) the accused did not unequivocally plead guilty to the charge as properly understood; or (3) the accused, on the facts offered in support of the charge, could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged.} The majority in \textit{Wong} affirmed this approach, while the minority dissented on a different issue. Although this requirement has been functionally ubiquitous in appellate decisions since \textit{Adgey}, the term ``unequivocal'' is not uniformly understood. As will be seen later in this thesis, how this term is explicitly understood impacts whether Canadian law permits exculpatory no-contest pleas.

The plea that a court accepts is the plea the defendant intended to enter.


Two approaches in Canada. The first believes that ``unequivocal'' applies to the defendant's subjective intent to enter the plea. They unequivocally admit that they were responsible for the offence. The second believes that ``unequivocal'' applies to the defendant's subjective intent to effect the consequences of their plea. They unequivocally acknowledge that they intend to self-convict.

The latter approach is more robust for several reasons. 

It also encompasses and accounts for cases that emerge under the first approach. Take, for example, a

\subsubsection{Codification}

In 2002, these requirements were codified as \textit{Criminal Code} s 606(1.1). This section, which I will examine in greater detail in §§3.1f below, lays out the conditions the court expects the defendant to meet before accepting a guilty plea from them. The \textit{Criminal Code} does not 

The statutory plea inquiry formalizes the legal fact that defendants do not have a right, as such, to enter guilty pleas, as these are always at the discretion of the court to accept or reject.
