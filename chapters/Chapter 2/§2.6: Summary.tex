\section{Summary}

A no-contest plea is any plea to a criminal charge where the defendant agrees to self-conviction without the prosecutor having to call evidence against them. Two of these pleas, guilty and \textit{nolo contendere}, have been formally authorized and legislated in various jurisdictions throughout America. In contrast, Parliament has only formally recognized the guilty plea in Canada. Although \textit{nolo contendere} pleas were developed in Britain and imported to North America alongside British rule, only America appears to have ever historically adopted it before the 21\textsuperscript{th} century. The following section explores the consequences of this forked development and examines whether it would be \textit{possible} to merge \textit{nolo contendere} pleas into Canadian criminal law.
